    <summary>Duplicacy: A lock-free deduplication cloud backup tool</summary>
    <description>Duplicacy is a new generation cross-platform cloud backup tool based on the idea of [Lock-Free Deduplication](https://github.com/gilbertchen/duplicacy/wiki/Lock-Free-Deduplication).  

This repository hosts source code, design documents, and binary releases of the command line version of Duplicacy.  There is also a Duplicacy GUI frontend built for Windows and Mac OS X available from https://duplicacy.com.

There is a special edition of Duplicacy developed for VMware vSphere (ESXi) named [Vertical Backup](https://www.verticalbackup.com) that can back up virtual machine files on ESXi to local drives, network or cloud storages.

## Features

There are 3 core advantages of Duplicacy over any other open-source or commercial backup tools:

* Duplicacy is the *only* cloud backup tool that allows multiple computers to back up to the same cloud storage, taking advantage of cross-computer deduplication whenever possible, without direct communication among them.  This feature literally turns any cloud storage server supporting only a basic set of file operations into a sophisticated deduplication-aware server.  

* Unlike other chunk-based backup tools where chunks are grouped into pack files and a chunk database is used to track which chunks are stored inside each pack file, Duplicacy takes a database-less approach where every chunk is saved independently using its hash as the file name to facilitate quick lookups.  The lack of a centralized chunk database not only makes the implementation less error-prone, but also produces a highly maintainable piece of software with plenty of room for development of new features and usability enhancements.

* Duplicacy is fast.  While the performance wasn't the top-priority design goal, Duplicacy has been shown to outperform other backup tools by a considerable margin, as indicated by the following results obtained from a [benchmarking experiment](https://github.com/gilbertchen/benchmarking) backing up the [Linux code base](https://github.com/torvalds/linux) using Duplicacy and 3 other open-source backup tools.

## Getting Started

* [A brief introduction](https://github.com/gilbertchen/duplicacy/wiki/Quick-Start)
* [Command references](https://github.com/gilbertchen/duplicacy/wiki)
* [Building from source](https://github.com/gilbertchen/duplicacy/wiki/Installation)

## Storages

Duplicacy currently provides the following storage backends:

* Local disk
* SFTP
* Dropbox
* Amazon S3
* Wasabi
* DigitalOcean Spaces
* Google Cloud Storage
* Microsoft Azure
* Backblaze B2
* Google Drive
* Microsoft OneDrive
* Hubic
* OpenStack Swift
* WebDAV (under beta testing)
* pcloud (via WebDAV)
* Box.com (via WebDAV)

Please consult the [wiki page](https://github.com/gilbertchen/duplicacy/wiki/Storage-Backends) on how to set up Duplicacy to work with each cloud storage.

For reference, the following chart shows the running times (in seconds) of backing up the [Linux code base](https://github.com/torvalds/linux) to each of those supported storages:
